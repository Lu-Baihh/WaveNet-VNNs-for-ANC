# WaveNet-VNNs-for-ANC
The official implementation of WaveNet-VNNs for Active Noise Control (ANC), a fully causal solution.

This repository includes the implementation of WaveNet-VNNs and several traditional ANC algorithms for comparison. (Due to copyright restrictions, ODW-FDFeLMS is not included.)

## Acknowledgement
This code extensively references the excellent [SEtrain](https://github.com/Xiaobin-Rong/SEtrain) codebase. Special thanks to Siyuan Lian for contributions to the implementation of traditional ANC algorithms.
